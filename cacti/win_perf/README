TIMEZONES

Since the times in CSV logs do not specify any timezone, it is assumed to
be local time. If you need to work with different timezone you can set
the TZ environment variable to specify the local server's timezone.

Ex:
$ TZ=US/Pacific ./getlog SERVER '\Paging File(_Total)\% Usage'


BUGS

- Configuration is static (getlog.h)
- MALLOC_FREE is broken
- That can't be all...
